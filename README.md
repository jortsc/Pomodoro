# Pomodoro
This is a simple [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) cross-platform app written in [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) and [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org).

An executable can be downloaded for macOS under [Releases](https://github.com/piradoiv/Pomodoro/releases) section. It should just works fine on Windows and Linux, if you have time to build it on your platform.

## How it works

1. The countdown will start automatically, focus on your task!
2. When the current Pomodoro is over, the app will start blinking in red, recommending you to take a little break
3. When you are ready, click on the app to start your next Pomodoro

## Missing things

- The break isn't implemented yet (1.1.0)
- Checkmarks should be implemented, and use them for larger breaks (1.1.0)
- ~~A little bit of UX, so the _How it works_ section isn't needed ;)~~ (1.1.0)
