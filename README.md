# Pomodoro
This is a simple Pomodoro cross-platform app written in Free Pascal and Lazarus.

##Â How it works

1. Open the app, it will start the countdown automatically
2. It will start blinking in red when your Pomodoro is over
3. Click on the app, it will start the next countdown

## Missing things

- The break isn't implemented yet
- A little bit of UX, so the _How it works_ section isn't needed ;)
