# Pomodoro
This is a simple [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) cross-platform app written in [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) and [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org).

An executable can be downloaded for macOS X under [Releases](https://github.com/piradoiv/Pomodoro/releases) section. It should just works fine on Windows and Linux, if you have time to build it on your platform.

## How it works

1. Open the app, it will start the countdown automatically
2. It will start blinking in red when your Pomodoro is over
3. Click on the app, it will start the next countdown

## Missing things

- The break isn't implemented yet (1.1.0)
- Checkmarks should be implemented, and use them for larger breaks (1.1.0)
- ~~A little bit of UX, so the _How it works_ section isn't needed ;)~~ (1.1.0)
